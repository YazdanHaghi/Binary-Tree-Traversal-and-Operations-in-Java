## Overview

This project consists of two Java files:

1. `tree.java`: Contains the main logic for creating a binary tree, performing in-order, pre-order, and post-order tree traversals, and allowing user interactions to choose traversal methods.

2. `node.java`: Defines the `node` class for creating tree nodes, adding child nodes to parent nodes, and managing the binary tree structure.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YazdanHaghi/Binary-Tree-Traversal-and-Operations-in-Java.git
